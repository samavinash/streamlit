git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Streamlit production setup with authentication"

☁️ Step 3: Push to GitHub
Go to https://github.com

Create a new repository (e.g., streamlit-prod-auth)

Follow GitHub’s instructions to push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/streamlit-prod-auth.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


To use this **Streamlit production setup** on an **Ubuntu machine**, follow these step-by-step instructions:

---

## 🐧 How to Deploy Streamlit with Docker & Nginx on Ubuntu

---

### ✅ 1. **Install Required Packages**

Open your terminal and install:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
```

Enable Docker to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

⚠️ **Log out and log in again** (or run `newgrp docker`) to apply group changes.

---

### ✅ 2. **Download the Project Files**

1. Move to your project directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/streamlit_app && cd ~/streamlit_app
```

2. Download and unzip the file you got above:

   * If you're using a browser: [Download ZIP](sandbox:/mnt/data/streamlit_production_app.zip), then move it to Ubuntu.
   * Or download via command line:

```bash
wget https://chat.openai.com/sandbox/mnt/data/streamlit_production_app.zip
unzip streamlit_production_app.zip
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Build & Run the App**

In the `streamlit_app` folder:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

* This builds your Streamlit Docker image
* Starts both `streamlit` and `nginx` containers

---

### ✅ 4. **Access Your App**

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost
```

If deploying on a remote Ubuntu server, replace `localhost` with the server's IP or domain:

```
http://your-server-ip
```

---

### ✅ 5. **Make it Persistent / Background Mode**

Run in detached mode:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To view logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

To stop the app:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

### ✅ 6. (Optional) Add HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

If you're using a domain:

1. Install **Certbot**
2. Configure **Nginx** for SSL
3. Use `certbot` to install and manage certificates.

Let me know if you want this part added too.

---

## 🧪 Verify Everything

You can check running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

---

Would you like me to also include:

* 🔒 HTTPS (Let's Encrypt setup)?
* 👤 Basic login with Streamlit Authenticator?
* ☁️ Steps for cloud deployment (like AWS or DigitalOcean)?

Let me know what’s next!
